# Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-XC Product Engineering Sample Program

This series of products is a high-performance development board based on the ESP32-P4 chip, featuring a dual-core and single-core RISC-V architecture. It is equipped with a 3.4-inch 800 × 800 resolution IPS circular touch display and a 4-inch 720 × 720 resolution IPS circular touch display as options. It supports a rich array of human-machine interaction interfaces, including MIPI-CSI (with an integrated image signal processor ISP). It also supports USB OTG 2.0 HS for high-speed connection and comes with a 40-pin GPIO expansion interface, which is compatible with some Raspberry Pi HAT expansion boards, enabling broader application adaptability. The ESP32-P4 chip integrates a digital signature peripheral and a dedicated key management unit to ensure the security of data and operations. It is specifically designed for high-performance and high-security applications, fully meeting the higher demands of embedded applications for human-machine interface support, edge computing capabilities, and IO connection features.
